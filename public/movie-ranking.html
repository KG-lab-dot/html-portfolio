<h1>Best Movies of All Time, according to Kgotso</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies are:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Rocky</h3>

<p>Rocky tugs on my heartstrings with its underdog story and Adrian is the sweetest character ever.
    It's a classic that never gets old. I love how it captures the spirit of persveraance and triumph over adversity.
    The training montages are iconic, I love the music and I literally use the Rocky soundtracks when I train myself, lol.
</p>

<h3>2. The Godfather</h3>

<p>I love the Godfathers complex characters and the way it explores themes of power, family, and loyalty.
    The cinematography is stunning, and the performances are stellar. It also has a beautiful soundtracks and that
    is really important to me as I am a music head. Family and loyalty are thems that resonate with me deeply.

<h3>3. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>

<p>I watched this movie maybe twice, I think I will visit it tonight lol. But it has stuck with me emotionally. 
    Although I do not remember the plot, I remember the feeling it left me with. The soundtrack is also amazing.
    A great rapper by the name of Jay Electronica sampled the soundtrack for one of his projects and it is a piece of artistic gold.

    <h4>Eternal Sunshine of the Splotless Mind by Alexander Pope:</h4>

    How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!<br />
    The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br />
    Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br />
    Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.<br />
